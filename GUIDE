If you want to test the code directly, just install the .exe and run it. Here's a guide.
1.
MODIFY MATRIX
➢
Insert Vertex.
Inserts a new vertex into the graph.
➢
Insert Edge.
Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph, including its weight.
➢
Delete Vertex.
Deletes a vertex and its associated edges.
➢
Delete Edge.
Deletes an edge between two vertices.
2.
SHOW GRAPH
Displays the stored list of linked lists.
3.
SHOW MATRIX
Displays the graph's adjacency matrix with its weights.
4.
CARDINALITY
Displays the number of distinct nodes within the graph.
5.
X ADJACENT TO Y
Validates whether a source node is adjacent to a destination node.
6.
QUADRATIC MATRIX
Displays the quadratic matrix of the adjacency matrix.
7.
CUBIC MATRIX
Displays the cubic matrix of the adjacency matrix.
8.
TREES
➢
Breadth-first traversal.
Performs a breadth-first traversal (BFS).
➢
Depth-first traversal.
Performs a depth-first traversal (DFS).
➢
Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal).
Constructs a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm.
➢
Minimum Spanning Tree (PRIM).
Constructs a minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.
➢
Dijkstra Path.
❖
Dijkstra start.
Find the shortest path from a starting vertex to all other vertices.
❖
Dijkstra start end.
Find the shortest path between a starting vertex and a destination vertex.
